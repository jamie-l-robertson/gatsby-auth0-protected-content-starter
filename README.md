# Auth0 Gatsby - Auth0 - Storyblok - Algolia - Starter - WIP
This is a sample application using Gatsby, Auth0 and Storyblok. It's based on the [official Gatsby hello-world starter](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-hello-world).

To get started, clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jamie-l-robertson/gatsby-auth0-protected-content-starter.git
```

## Pre-requisites for Gatsby

### Node & NPM
You'll need Node and yarn installed on your machine to run this project. You can verify your installations by running these commands:

```bash
node -v
yarn -v
```

If you don’t have `node` and `npm` installed, check out [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) and install the correct version for your operating system. 

### Install modules

If you've cloned this repository, navigate into the directory and install the npm modules using this command:

```bash
yarn install
```

## Auth0
This application uses Auth0 to manage identity.

### Sign Up for Auth0

You'll need an [Auth0](https://auth0.com) account to manage authentication. You can [sign up for a free Auth0 account here](https://auth0.com/signup). Next, set up an Auth0 Client so Auth0 can interface with your app.

### Set Up a Client App

1. Go to your [**Auth0 Dashboard**](https://manage.auth0.com/#/) and click the "[create a new client](https://manage.auth0.com/#/clients/create)" button. 
2. Name your new app, select "Single Page Web Applications", and click the "Create" button.
3. In the **Settings** for your new Auth0 client app, add `http://localhost:8000/auth0_callback` to the **Allowed Callback URLs** and `http://localhost:8000` to **Allowed Logout URLs** and **Allowed Web Origins**.
4. Click the "Save Changes" button.
5. If you'd like, you can [set up some social connections](https://manage.auth0.com/#/connections/social). You can then enable them for your app in the **Client** options under the **Connections** tab. The example shown in the screenshot above utilizes username/password database, Facebook, Google, and Twitter.

> **Note:** Under the **OAuth** tab of **Advanced Settings** (at the bottom of the **Settings** section) you should see that the **JsonWebToken Signature Algorithm** is set to `RS256`. This is  the default for new clients. If it is set to `HS256`, please change it to `RS256`. You can [read more about RS256 vs. HS256 JWT signing algorithms here](https://community.auth0.com/questions/6942/jwt-signing-algorithms-rs256-vs-hs256).

### Modify auth config

Rename `.env.EXAMPLE` to `.env.development` (or `.env.production`) and replace `<value>` for `AUTH0_DOMAIN` and `AUTH0_CLIENTID` with your Auth0 domain prefix and your client ID. These can be found on your [client dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/#/clients).

Replace the `<value>` for `AUTH0_CALLBACK` with the URL for your callback route. The default for development is `http://localhost:8000/callback`.

## Custom claims
If you are using custom claims, you will need to define the namespace you used in `.env.development` (or `.env.production`). See `.env.EXAMPLE`.

## Storyblok

You'll need a Storyblok space setup and the a preview/public API key. See [Storyblok's guide](https://www.storyblok.com/tc/gatsbyjs) for getting started.

Once you have your Space setup, grab your API key from Space name > Settings > API Keys and place in the .env.(development|production) file.

## Algolia

An algolia application will need setup, [sign up here](https://www.algolia.com), once application is created, add the required keys into your  `.env.development` (or `.env.production`) files.

Search is index on `Gatsby build` and indexes the following:

- objectID
- slug
- name
- title
- description
- field_component
- full_slug

to expand this further, see `/src/utils/algolia-queries.js` for guidance.


## Run the app
You can start the development server with the following command:

```bash
gatsby develop
```

The app runs at `localhost:8000` by default.

The Graphql server can be reached at `localhost:8000/__graphql` by default.
